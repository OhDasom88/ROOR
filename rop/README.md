# Reading-Order-Prediction Methods

1. Please follow the instructions from `make_weights/README.md` to prepare the pre-trained models, and configure their local paths in the shells.
2. Run `train.sh` for ROP model training.
3. Run `predict.sh` to generate pseudo reading order relation labels from saved checkpoints.
